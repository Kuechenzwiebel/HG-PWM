# PWM-Servo-Libary
A C++ PWM and servo library for Raspberry Pi; based on WiringPi.

This is the testing branch. So nothing is guaranteed to work.

# Current state of development

PWM works precise on Raspberry Pi 4B and 3B+,
plan to test on 2B.

Generate servo PWM signals. Sort of working allready
